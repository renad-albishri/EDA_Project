# DIGITAL MEDIA COMPANY(DMC) FOR ADVERTISING 

# Goal
The goal of this project is preprocessing and analyzing MTA Turnstile dataset to be used in identifying the most crowded subway stations to be choosen by the DMC to increase the profit of it.

# Prepossessing  
Cleaned the data by renaming columns, adding calculated fields, removing erroneous data, and aggregating by station and date.
it's done by added the 'Week_days,' 'Month,' and Year columns to be used for finding the highest traffic per months or days. The analysis found that some station weekdays had the most increased traffic, but this was less the case for some stations; certain days also had anomalous traffic flows.

To start exploring the goal, I used in this graph a bar chart with two features (Stations, Dialy_Entries) to show the most crowded subway stations which are used to give many choices to the company which benefit from this data.
